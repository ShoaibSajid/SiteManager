# Multi-Site Inventory Analysis Dashboard

A comprehensive web-based analysis tool for managing inventory across multiple storage sites. This dashboard helps managers identify shortages, critical items, abundant items, and provides shipping recommendations.

## Features

- **Dashboard Overview**: Real-time statistics across all sites
- **Site Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of inventory per site
- **Shortage Detection**: Identify items with low or negative inventory
- **Critical Items**: Highlight items requiring immediate attention
- **Abundance Analysis**: Find items with excess inventory
- **Shipping Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions for inventory redistribution
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for better insights

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure your Excel file `Data Jul-Nov 2025.xlsx` is in the project directory

2. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Data Format

The Excel file should contain the following columns:
- `Plant`: Site/plant identifier (this is used as the primary site identifier)
- `Storage Location`: Storage location within a plant (for reference)
- `Material`: Material code
- `Material Description`: Description of the material
- `Quantity`: Quantity (positive for additions, negative for removals)
- `Unit of Entry`: Unit of measurement
- `Document Date`: Date of the transaction
- Other columns are optional but may be used for additional analysis

**Note**: The system uses the `Plant` column to identify different sites. Currently, your data has 1 plant (MR10), but the system is ready to handle data from 4 plants in the future.
