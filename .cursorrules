# SiteManager Project Rules

## Currency and Localization
- Always use PKR (Pakistani Rupees) for currency display, never USD or dollar signs
- Format currency as: `PKR ${Number(value).toLocaleString()}` in JavaScript
- Do not use `currency: 'USD'` in toLocaleString options

## Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Use consistent indentation (spaces, not tabs)
- Maintain existing naming conventions (camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python)

## Git Workflow
- After making changes, always commit them with descriptive messages
- Push changes to GitHub after committing
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why

## File Structure
- Keep Flask routes in `app.py`
- Keep data processing logic in `data_processor.py`
- Keep frontend JavaScript in `static/js/`
- Keep styles in `static/css/`
- Keep templates in `templates/`

## API Endpoints
- All API endpoints should return JSON
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include error messages in JSON responses

## Data Processing
- The Excel file `Data Jul-Nov 2025.xlsx` is the primary data source
- Always validate data before processing
- Handle missing or invalid data gracefully

## Testing
- Test changes in the browser after making modifications
- Ensure the Flask server runs without errors
- Verify all API endpoints return expected data

## Dependencies
- Keep `requirements.txt` updated with all Python dependencies
- Use specific version numbers for dependencies when possible
- Document any new dependencies added
